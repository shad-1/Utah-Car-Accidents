- Decide on what criteria we want to filter
    - Right now it is just county. Every page using the FilterVC will need to set ViewBag.SelectedCat or set it on a ViewModel.
    - ViewBag.Title will be the H1

- Get rid of SessionExtensions and UrlExtensions if they are not needed (which is probably the case)

- View model for the dashboard page needs to include crash, location information, and all the true features for a given crash
